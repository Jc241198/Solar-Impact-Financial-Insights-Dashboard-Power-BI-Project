## 📊 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard is a comprehensive, visual story of how a residential solar rooftop installation impacts electricity consumption, grid dependency, billing, and long-term savings. The goal is to **track the financial and energy performance** post-solar installation with clear comparisons to the previous non-solar consumption pattern.

It serves as a **living, perennial report** — with monthly data manually updated to reflect ongoing usage and savings over the years.

🌟 Key Features

### ✅ 1. KPI Summary Cards
- **Total Solar Units Produced**
- **Units Exported to Grid**
- **Revenue Earned from Exports**
- **Actual Bill Paid**
- **Total EMI Paid**
- **ROI Progress (%)**

These cards highlight high-level numbers driving ROI and system performance.

### ✅ 2. Monthly Solar Production

📆 Monthly Generation Details

Visualizes how much solar power was generated each month, helping understand seasonal trends and panel performance.

### ✅ 3. Solar Savings Journey

 💰 Savings Breakdown  
![Solar Savings Details](screenshots/Solar%20Savings%20Details.png)

Tracks:
- The hypothetical **bill amount without solar**
- The actual **bill amount with solar + EMI**
- The **Net Monthly Savings**

→ This highlights the real financial value of installing solar power.

### ✅ 4. Cumulative Savings Waterfall Chart
A creative representation showing how monthly savings stack up over time, providing a **clear ROI trajectory**.

### ✅ 5. Power Usage Pattern
Compares power consumption in 2025 (post-solar) vs 2024 (pre-solar) to evaluate **behavioral shifts** in usage and possible conservation habits post solar installation.

### ✅ 6. Solar Energy Utilization Donut
Breakdown of how generated solar energy is used:
- Self-consumed
- Exported to grid

This helps evaluate if the household is utilizing most of the solar energy or exporting more.

### ✅ 7. Monthly Consumption Source Breakdown
Stacked column chart showing:
- Units consumed from solar
- Units consumed from grid

Helps evaluate **grid dependency vs energy independence**.
