# 🌞 Solar Imapact & Financial Insights Dashboard 

![Home Page](Home%20Page.png)

## 📌 Project Overview

This Power BI dashboard offers a **comprehensive and personalized view** of solar energy usage, financial savings, and ROI performance from a **5 kW rooftop solar installation** at my residence. Designed as a **perennial dashboard**, it updates automatically every month with new consumption and generation data.

## 🎯 Objective

> To visually analyze and track the **financial, environmental, and consumption impact** of going solar — comparing life **before and after** rooftop solar installation.

## 🧠 Key Questions This Dashboard Answers:

- How much electricity is my solar plant generating monthly?
- How much of that energy is exported to the grid?
- What would my bill be **without solar** vs. **with solar**?
- How much am I saving each month after factoring in bank EMI?
- What’s my return on investment and how fast am I recovering the plant cost?
- Am I still heavily dependent on the electricity grid?
- Is the plant generating **as expected** or underperforming?
