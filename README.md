# 🌞 Rooftop Solar Impact & Financial Insights Dashboard

## 📌 About the Project

This dashboard is a **real-time, personal project** built using Power BI to analyze the performance of a 5kW rooftop solar plant installed at my residence. The goal is to measure the effectiveness of solar adoption in terms of **cost savings, energy independence, and ROI** through clean, interactive visualizations.

It is a **perennial dashboard**—updated monthly with fresh data, and designed to grow over time.

## 💼 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Power BI** (DAX, Custom Tooltips, Visual Storytelling)
- **Excel** (Manual Monthly Entry, Base Calculations)
- **Data Modeling & Relationships**
- **Advanced DAX for Dynamic Insights**

## 📊 Key Features & Visuals

### 🔹 Monthly Solar Production & Performance Labels  
Tracks solar generation per month with performance labels (Above Expectation / Within Range / Below Expectation) using conditional formatting and custom tooltips.

### 🔹 Billing & ROI Journey  
This dual-axis visual shows:
- Total Bill Without Solar  
- Effective Bill With Solar (after applying EMI, solar revenue)  
- Net Savings  
- Cumulative ROI Tracker

## 🔍 Insights Generated

- 📈 Monthly generation trend vs benchmark (20 units/day → 600 units/month)
- 🔁 Grid dependency before vs after solar
- 💡 Self-consumption vs export ratio
- 💰 Total savings vs investment tracking (including EMI impact)
- 📊 Real ROI progress month by month
- 🧠 Tooltip-based micro insights on every month

## 🧮 DAX Measures Used

- `PerformanceLabel` for expected vs actual generation
- `EffectiveBill = ActualBillPaid + EMI - Solar Revenue`
- `NetSavings = TotalBill - EffectiveBill`
- `ROI Progress % = CumulativeSavings / TotalCostOfPlant`

## 📅 How This Helps

This dashboard:
- Educates about solar investment decisions  
- Helps track ROI in real terms  
- Allows comparison of performance over months  
- Acts as a **personalized decision-support system**

## 🔁 Scalable Design

- New month? Just **update the Excel sheet** and refresh Power BI.
- All visuals, insights, and tooltips update automatically.
- **Calendar table** manages month order and filtering smoothly.

## 🌟 Final Note

This is **my own home solar story**, built not just for analytics but to inspire others. With climate goals becoming urgent, projects like these can prove how **data + green energy = smart investment**.

If you can, **go solar today**—for savings and sustainability. 🌱
